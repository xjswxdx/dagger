Dagger
======

A fast dependency injector for Android and Java.

About Google's Fork
-------------

Dagger 2.0 is a completely compile-time evolution of the Dagger approach to dependency injection,
eliminating all reflection, and moving towards user-specified access to managed graphs (vs.
the traditional Context/Injector/ObjectGraph found in earlier dependency-injection frameworks.

This github project represents the Dagger 2.0 development stream.  The earlier 
[project page][square] (Square, Inc's repository) represents the earlier 1.0 development stream.  
Both versions have benefitted from strong involvement from Square, Google, and other contributors. 

Status
------

***Version:* 2.0-SNAPSHOT** 

Dagger is currently in active development, primarily internally at Google, with regular pushes
to the open-source community.  Snapshot releases are auto-deployed to sonatype's central maven
repository on a clean build with the version tag `2.0-SNAPSHOT`.

Dagger 2.0 is pre-alpha and should be used with caution, though it is usable.  Stable 
pre-releases will be made as stable points in 2.0's development occur.

Documentation
-------------

The Dagger project will undergo a documentation re-vamp in preparation for 2.0.  In the mean-time,
you can get an initial picture of Dagger 2.0's direction from [the original proposal][proposal],
[this talk by Greg Kick][gaktalk], and discussions on the dagger-discuss@googlegroups.com 
mailing list.

Also, Javadocs are updated on every merge and are [available here][latestapi]

Usage
--------

You will need to include the `dagger-2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` in your
application's runtime.   In order to activate code generation you will need to
include `dagger-compiler-2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` in your build at compile time.

In a Maven project, one would include the runtime in the dependencies section
of your `pom.xml` (replacing `${dagger.version}` with the appropriate current
release), and the `dagger-compiler` artifact as an "optional" or "provided"
dependency:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.dagger</groupId>
    <artifactId>dagger</artifactId>
    <version>2.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.google.dagger</groupId>
    <artifactId>dagger-compiler</artifactId>
    <version>2.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <optional>true</optional>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Other build systems that can consume maven dependencies can use these jars in the usual way.
